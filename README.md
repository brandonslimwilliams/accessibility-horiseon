# accessibility-horiseon
## For this challenge type we had to make the website (Horiseon) accessible. While dpoing so we add to interpret the scout rule and code refactor.
### I added alt to all pictures, added semantic elements, and Horiseon to the title in the head. 
#### These are the semantic elements that were added

* section
* main
* footer
* aside
